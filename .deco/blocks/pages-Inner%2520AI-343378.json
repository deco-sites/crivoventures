        "title": "why did we invest in InnerAI?",
        "content": "<p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\">InnerAI has an excelent team led by Pedro Salles and Eduardo Mitelman.

While the AI industry is dominated by giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta, we believe that companies offering vertical and tailored experiences will have space to thrive.
