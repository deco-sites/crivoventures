SuperAutor addresses a significant problem in the education sector: low language proficiency levels, particularly in countries like Brazil. While parents are increasingly concerned about the lack of motivation and engagement in their children's education, schools also struggle to find effective methods to engage students.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">And last but definitely not least, is the experienced team with a strong track record in the educational industry. Bruno Damasco, CEO, has over 16 years of experience in technology and education industries and founded WPensar. João Morales (Operations and Talent) has investment banking experience and was the former CFO and CHRO of WPensar. And Pedro Gigante (Chief of Growth), another WPensar co-founder, has over 10 years of experience in sales to schools.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">SuperAutor's unique B2B2C business model sets them apart from other edtech companies. They utilize schools as a distribution channel to reach parents, offering them the opportunity to purchase books written by their children at the end of the school year. This approach provides a competitive advantage as schools are willing to participate in the distribution process, unlike being the buyers themselves. Additionally, parents are compelled to buy their child's first book, resulting in over 80% of parents purchasing at least one product.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">The market opportunity for SuperAutor is substantial, considering the challenges faced by the education sector in Brazil. A staggering 64% of 3rd grade students struggle with reading and writing, and schools encounter difficulties in engaging students in writing activities while teachers struggle to create and implement new projects. Furthermore, the dominance of public schools, accounting for 85% of the total, makes it challenging to penetrate the educational market. However, SuperAutor has positioned itself as a valuable solution with its affordable price point of $26 per student per year. The potential market in Brazil alone is estimated at $3.1 billion, highlighting the significant growth potential for the company.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">SuperAutor's growth strategy is rooted in the team's deep understanding of the education sector. The founders bring valuable experience from their previous startup, WPensar (acquired by Arco Educação), where they successfully exited. This experience provides them with a profound knowledge and network in education. Recognizing the challenges of selling products directly to schools, especially public institutions, SuperAutor focuses on reaching out to schools and showcasing how their product enhances literacy and helps teachers create engaging classes. By onboarding schools onto their platform, SuperAutor generates revenue from parents who are eager to invest in their children's education by purchasing the recommended books.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">In conclusion, our decision to invest in SuperAutor was driven by their innovative approach to addressing the pressing issues of student motivation and literacy. Their unique B2B2C model, impressive results, substantial market opportunity, and strategic growth strategy give us confidence in their potential for success. We are excited to support SuperAutor as they continue to make a positive impact in the education sector and empower students to thrive academically.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","image":{"label":"team superautor","width":492.86,"height":579.65},"details":"<p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><strong>Edtech focused on teaching young children to read and write.</strong></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><strong>Founders</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-damasco-78562949/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-damasco-78562949/\" style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><span class=\"sqsrte-text-color--black\">Bruno Damasco</span></a><span class=\"sqsrte-text-color--black\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrogigantemarques/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrogigantemarques/\" style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><span class=\"sqsrte-text-color--black\">Pedro Gigante</span></a><span class=\"sqsrte-text-color--black\"> e </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-morales-99032a202/\" data-mce-href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-morales-99032a202/\" style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><span class=\"sqsrte-text-color--black\">João Morales</span></a></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><strong>Website:</strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(209, 115, 76);\" data-mce-style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(209, 115, 76);\"><a href=\"https://superautor.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"https://superautor.com.br/\" style=\"color: rgb(209, 115, 76); text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(209, 115, 76); text-decoration: underline;\" data-mce-selected=\"inline-boundary\">https://superautor.com.br/﻿</a></span></span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\"><strong>Year of Investment:</strong> 2022</span></p>","__resolveType":"site/sections/Main/About.tsx"}],"__resolveType":"$live/pages/LivePage.tsx"}
