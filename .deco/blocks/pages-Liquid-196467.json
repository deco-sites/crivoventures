Our decision to back them was based on three pillars: team, market, and product.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40)\">Brazil’s real estate sector, especially in the mid- to low-income housing segments, remains largely under-digitized. Developers often bear the credit risk early in the buyer journey, long before bank financing is formalized. Recent structural shifts, such as the expansion of Minha Casa Minha Vida, the growth of pro-soluto financing, and tighter access to capital, have amplified the need for smarter, scalable credit infrastructure.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40)\">Liquid sits precisely at this intersection. Their platform combines real-time credit decisioning, automated portfolio monitoring, and a no-code credit builder, enabling developers to de-risk early-stage sales, improve portfolio quality, and unlock liquidity. By integrating credit bureau data, Open Finance, and proprietary scoring models, Liquid delivers instant approvals at the point of sale while continuously tracking buyer financial health until property delivery.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40)\">The market potential is significant: improving cash flow predictability and reducing default risk directly impact a developer’s ability to grow. Liquid’s SaaS-based, API-driven infrastructure not only accelerates sales cycles but also enables integrations with CRMs, financial institutions, and notaries, making financing processes more efficient for all stakeholders.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40)\">Finally, we believe great teams build great companies. Thiago’s deep technical expertise in AI and credit systems, Luiza’s proven track record in strategic partnerships and commercial operations, and Odair’s decades-long experience in credit cycle management position Liquid to become the go-to infrastructure layer for real estate financing&nbsp;in&nbsp;Brazil.</span></p>",
