        "content": "<p>Our decision to support Revi stems from our confidence in its strong team, the immense market opportunity, and the impressive early traction of its product. We are also very bullish in their founder product fit.&nbsp;</p><p><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p>One of the most compelling reasons we invested in Revi is the strength and experience of its founding team. Juliana Haddad, one of the co-founders, has a remarkable background, having previously worked at a similar company in the US, solving the same issue they’re solving at Revi. She witnessed and contributed to its growth from just 10 employees to 800, bringing great insights and expertise to the company. Nicholas Love, another co-founder, comes from a family deeply rooted in the retail sector. His lifelong exposure to the industry has given him a unique understanding of its opportunities and challenges. Marcelo Miyachi, the third co-founder, is a self-taught developer who began coding at the age of 12. His technical prowess and passion for innovation are crucial assets to Revi’s technological development.</p><p><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p>Brazil's retail market presents a significant opportunity for growth and innovation. Brazil is one of the largest retail markets in the world, with a market size of approximately $600 billion. The sector has shown resilience and potential for digital transformation, especially in the wake of recent global trends. Additionally, as Brazilians are heavy users of WhatsApp, many e-commerce companies are now using it as an important channel to interact with end users. This trend highlights the increasing importance of digital communication tools in enhancing customer engagement and driving sales.The increasing penetration of e-commerce and the need for improved customer experience in retail further amplify the market potential for Revi.&nbsp;</p><p>This favorable market environment aligns perfectly with Revi’s strategic objectives, positioning it for substantial growth and success. From its inception, Revi has demonstrated exceptional product traction. The company has quickly garnered attention and adoption, reflecting the strong demand for its solutions in the retail sector. Early feedback from customers has been overwhelmingly positive, validating the product’s value proposition and its potential to revolutionize the retail experience in Brazil. This early success reinforces our belief in Revi’s ability to scale and make a significant impact in the industry.</p><p><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p>In summary, our investment in Revi is driven by our belief in the exceptional capabilities of its founding team, the vast market opportunities in Brazil’s retail sector, and the impressive early traction of its product. We are excited to support Revi’s journey and look forward to witnessing its continued growth and success</p>"
