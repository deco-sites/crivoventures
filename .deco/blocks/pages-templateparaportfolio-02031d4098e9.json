Here's our heartfelt reasoning behind this strategic decision.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">Dinerama is led by a dynamic duo: Fernando Brustolini as CEO and Bruna Pereira as CTO. Their combined experience in digital products and scaling hyper-growth technologies brings a unique blend of expertise to the table.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">In the realm of CPG, measuring the return on investment (ROI) for marketing efforts has always been a challenge. This is especially true in Latin America, where the majority of retail sales take place in physical stores, leaving CPG companies with limited access to valuable consumer data. Dinerama recognized this significant gap and set out to bridge it.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">Their solution lies in a powerful data analytics platform that provides CPG brands with unprecedented insights into consumers' purchase behavior. But what sets Dinerama apart is their user-centric approach. They developed a free app that incentivizes users to share their data by offering them cashback rewards when they shop offline for their favorite brands. It's a win-win situation that fosters loyalty and engagement for both consumers and brands.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">Dinerama's innovative product seamlessly connects users, brands, and retailers in a dynamic ecosystem. Brands gain access to invaluable insights that empower them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies. At the same time, users are rewarded for their loyalty, creating a trusted relationship and a sense of appreciation for the brands they love.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">The market potential for Dinerama is enormous. In Brazil alone, with a workforce of over 100 million people spending an average of $1,239 on groceries annually, the addressable market is substantial. By leveraging conservative estimations, with a 25% take rate and a 25% basket with cashback, the market sizing for Dinerama reaches a mind-boggling $7.7 billion. And with positive consumer trends favoring cashback rewards and the accelerated adoption of QR code payments, the environment is ripe for Dinerama's growth. Moreover, the mandatory QR code on consumer receipts in Brazil grants them access to valuable purchase data, further enhancing their offering.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">Lastly, we cannot overlook the strength of the Dinerama team. With Fernando's extensive experience as a product manager in successful startups like Nubank and Méliuz, alongside Bruna's expertise as a lead engineer at Creditas and Nubank, they have already achieved remarkable results with limited resources. Their tenacity, skill, and ability to navigate challenges make us confident in their ability to drive Dinerama to new heights.</span></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\"></p><p class=\"preFade fadeIn opacity-0 opacity-100\"><span style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\" data-mce-style=\"color: rgb(23, 75, 40);\">In conclusion, our investment in Dinerama reflects our unwavering belief in their innovative solutions and their potential to revolutionize the CPG industry. With their game-changing data analytics platform, user-centric approach, impressive growth, and a massive addressable market, Dinerama is positioned for unparalleled success. We are honored to be part of their journey as they redefine the landscape of consumer data analytics.</span></p>"},"newDetails":{"founders":[{"founderLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-brustolini/","founderName":"Fernando Brustolini"},{"founderLink":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppbruna/","founderName":"Bruna Pereira"}],"companyInfo":"Data analytics app for CPG companies.","websiteLink":{"link":"https://dinerama.com.br","external":true},"yearInvestment":"2022"},"__resolveType":"site/sections/Main/NewAbout.tsx"}],"__resolveType":"$live/pages/LivePage.tsx"}
